## The story of *Mr. Amateur* and *Mr. Consumer*

Let us take the tale of two people. Let's call them *Mr. Amateur* and *Mr. Consumer*. Both have a keen interest in photography. Both want to get some recognition for the snapshots they take. Mr. Amateur's photo feed is buzzing with myriads of good shots. Mr. Consumer's one feels very average. He can't help but feel a little jealous of Mr. Amateur. He quickly deduces that it must be the latest high-end lens that is helping Mr. Amateur produce those great shots.

Sparing no moment, Mr. Consumer goes online and places the order for the amazing 35mm f/1.2 AF lens. After all, what's 999 USD when you can take your photographs to the next level.

After two weeks of attempts, Mr. Consumer finds that his photographs have improved but not enough to compete with Mr. Amateur's photo feed. He deduces that it must be because of the camera he was using. He had owned it for the last two years. The good guys at the camera company had updated their sensors and written a new software for the latest iteration of his model.

Mr. Consumer does what he is habituated of. He goes online, whips out his credit card and places an order of the latest iteration of his camera body for 2500 USD.

Mr. Consumer fiddles again for a week. He is able to observe some more improvements but the images don't have the spark that the photographs of Mr. Amateur have. He is unable to pin-point it. He decides to contact Mr. Amateur to know the settings that he uses on his camera.

Mr. Amateur, as it turn out, is a very kind man. He mails him all the settings he had used to get the shots that he felt had truly come out well. To Mr. Consumer's surprise, there wasn't anything out of the ordinary.

 Mr. Amateur knows something that Mr. Consumer doesn't. Photography, like many other art-forms, require a gradual building of one's skill. It requires **patience** and **the art of deliberate practice**. In fact, the camera he was using was 10 years old. He had bought it from a pawn shop. The lens was a manual focus lens he had picked up for next to nothing from a guy who did not like using his old film SLR anymore.

## Equipment cannot mask the lack of skill

If you have a hobby, and would want to take it further, then you should know that money and equipment cannot substitute the lack of skill. Yet, this is one thing that I have seen people overlook the most. Heck, I have been guilty of subscribing to this illusion at times.

Most people divert their disposable income into the upgrading their hobby equipment. While this is certainly necessary at some point, it is only necessary only when one's skill surpasses the ability and exposure the equipment can provide. Yet, if you ask me, in most cases, an amateur can do very well for the rest of his life with equipment that are one or two levels lower than those that are used by professionals. Heck, even if you are a professional, you might do just fine with the equipment you have.

Companies charge a bomb for incremental features that functionally only cater to a small number of individuals. That's their secondary target audience. Their primary target audience are those who are willing to shell out their disposable income, not for the equipment but for bragging rights.

## Law of diminishing returns

No matter what hobby you have, you will always find this curve (from: [Celestine Chua](https://personalexcellence.co/blog/law-of-diminishing-returns/)).

There is a threshold of utility that is not shown in the graph. It is the minimum quality that is acceptable. It is perfectly possible that the barrier to entry for a hobby lies well beyond someone's means. However, we must also remember that such hobbies themselves lie well beyond the diminishing-return line when we take all hobbies you can pursue and plot their enjoyment against the cost threshold of utility.
