## A glass of water is best when it's not filled to the brim

We need headroom. Things need headroom. Audio needs headroom. In case you do not know, ask a mastering engineer how frustrated he will be if the mixing engineer sends him a mix that has no headroom for him to work with. Don't believe me? [Listen to this guy](http://productionadvice.co.uk/headroom-before-mastering/).

Your effort needs headroom. If you are into an endurance sport like cycling, then you would have heard about **pacing**. If not, how about reading about it on the [British Cycling website](https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/sportives/article/sp-Sportive-Tips---Pacing-your-ride-0). It is nearly impossible to complete a brevet without "bonking out" if one has not paced themselves correctly. I have experienced it multiple times in the past on long rides. Later, I have observed the same with guys new to long-distance cycling, who had accompanied me on long rides.

## If you don't max out, you can peak once in a while

The principle works in the same fashion no matter the situation

* Don't max out your effort.
* Don't max out on appointments.
* Don't max out on hedonism.
* Don't max out your expenses.
* Don't max out your credit card.

## Cycling can teach you something about your finances

Cycling is a strange sport. It asks of you to eat and drink while doing the activity. You can think of them as your income stream. With every pedal stroke, you spend some energy, some water and some salts. You can think of those as your recurring expenses. Once in a while, you would come face-to-face with a steep hill that would drain a lot of your energy. Think of them as the big expenses you have to encounter from time-to-time. Many a times there is always an option to bypass the climb. Many bike-packers and bike-tourers may prefer to take such an alternative route.

In the end, you would want to reach your destination with lots of energy left to enjoy the place. For that, your energy expenditure should be lesser than you energy intake. It's the same for finances. Colloquially, it is known as living beneath ones means.

## Analogies can only take you so far

It is possible to live frugally and enjoy your path to financial independence. However, it is not advisable to eat more than what would upset your dietary requirements. Hence, let's call the curtains on the analogy.
